# SMR

This library aims to implement various string metrics, such as basic ones like Levenshtein and Hamming distances, and then more complicated ones.

**DISCLAIMER :** It's a personnal implementation, do not have any particular expectation. This is just a cool way for me to learn Rust. However, I will always try to do my best to stick to original papers and/or existing/documented algorithms.

Here is a listing of all the currently implemented or planned string metrics :

- [ ] Hamming distance
- [x] Levenshtein distance
- [x] Damerau-Levenshtein distance
  - [x] Berghel and Roach algorithm
  - [ ] Ukkonen algorithm
  - [ ] ... (todo)
- [ ] Other string metrics (still don't really know wich ones)
